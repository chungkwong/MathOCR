Using MathOCR in command line

Usage:
java -jar MathOCR.jar -cli [options] files...
To learn more about the options, type:
java -jar MathOCR.jar -cli


Using MathOCR in your java program（for developer）

(1) Place the JAR file of MathOCR into classpath
(2) Import classes
import com.github.chungkwong.mathocr.*;
Set parameter
Use the method of the object com.github.chungkwong.mathocr.Environment.ENVIRONMENT
(3) Put the image of the pages into a List(Accept File, URL, InputStream or BufferedImage)
(4) Recognition(Assume the List above is denoted by `pages`)
new PipeLine(pages.iterator()).getResult();
